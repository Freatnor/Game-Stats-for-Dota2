## Known bugs
 - Tapping on the latest match section of a search result or followed player can crash the app if the account does not have a latest match (i.e. never played dota 2)
 - the follow button on the player detail page does not toggle to "unfollow"
 - unfollowing a player does not refresh the followed list (only restarting the app or adding a followed person does)
 - Recycler Views on the match detial page can become stuck and also have odd heights when opened
